# Quantity Trupms Quality

    When learning to code practice is key, you may want to spend time perfecting code lines or playing code golf but getting the code out there is the most important. Practicing will produce quantity over quality code but producing a hight quantity will alow more growth and development as a dev rather than perfecting code. 

# Clean Code: Chapter 1

    Writing clean code can be abstract. There isnt a way a practice to write clean code, everyone had a different method and style. Clean code is about readability, messy code that needs to be re-written will kill productivity while you spend precious time cleaning up poorly written code. Most code will be read rather than written, if the code isnt very readable who every may be working on the code next would need to spend time figuring out the code rather than adding features or progressing that code. 

# TDD red-green-refactor

    Using TDD allows a dev to tackle a problem while also knowing youre going to get the desired solution. The method red-green-refactor, tou make a test first, red means its not passing because the function hasnt been written yet. Green means youve made a function that passes the test, and refactoring will allow the test to run faster as well as building a cleaner code base. 

# Cycles of TDD

   Developing using TDD is a practice thats been around for awhile, and scales in time as you go through the process. You first want to start small making one test case for a function, then a test that will test a more specific case and so on. At some point these tests and changes could affect the schema of the code base and the dev needs to check every hour or so to make sure they havent written code that breaks the rest of the code base.
