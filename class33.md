## Composition vs Inheritance (https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
* When a component doesnt know their children ahead of time like a sidebar, using prop to pass children elements is recommended
* React elements can be passed like any other data
* It is suggested that to reuse non-UI functionality between components, to extract it into a separate JS module and import it.
