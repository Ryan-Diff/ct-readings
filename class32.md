## context api https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
* Context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
* it should be used for global variables
* it should be used when multiple components need the data at different nesting levels
* every context object comes with a provider component, they will all re render whenever the providers value prop changes
